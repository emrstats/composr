# composr: A package for working with compositional data

A WIP to develop a package covering the range of compositional data needs, building from the original paper by Aitchison  as there are some packages that already exist for compositional data, but there are none that work within the `tidyverse` and all work with frequentist assumptions. This is an attempt to correct both of these lacks.
